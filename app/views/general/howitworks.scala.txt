        <p class="lead">
            Our fundraising model allows schools to raise a greater amount of money per individual participant by tapping a broader community of supporters. Rather than being limited to friends and family who live close enough to purchase wrapping paper or attend an event, Scholastic Challenge creates fundraising opportunities that encourage donations from loved ones, friends and acquaintances around the globe.
