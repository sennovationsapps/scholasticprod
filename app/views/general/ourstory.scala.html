        <p class="lead">
            In 2008, after 15 years of fundraising for children, a group of parents were tired of the status quo and believed there was a better way to serve schools. As school district budgets were being slashed due to the economic recession and instructional standards began to falter, it was clear that increased financial support from the private sector was needed to support and maintain California's premier primary education system.

          Working collaboratively with family and friends, leveraging their background in software, event management and physical fitness, Scholastic Challenge was created; a complete fundraising solution that can work with a single school or an entire school district for a single event to leverage sponsorship and volunteers, utilizing online fundraising software tied to social networks, with automated fundraising guidance and event management. At Scholastic Challenge our goal is to increase funding for all schools, gain greater fundraising participation and build stronger community awareness, while decreasing educator and parental fundraising efforts.
