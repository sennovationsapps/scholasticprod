          <p>Your privacy is critically important to us. At Scholastic Challenge we have a few fundamental principles:
          <ul>
            <li>We don't ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.</li>
            <li>We don't share your personal information with anyone except as needed to run the fundraising event you are participating in, comply with the law, or protect our rights.</li>
            <li>We don't store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our events.</li>
          </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
          If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact us.

          <p>
          Scholastic Challenge operates the website www.scholasticchallenge.com. It is Scholastic Challenge's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating this website.
          </p>
          <h4>Website Visitors</h4>
          <p>Like most website operators, Scholastic Challenge collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Scholastic Challenge's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Scholastic Challenge's visitors use its website. From time to time, Scholastic Challenge may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
          <h4>Use of Your Personal Information</h4>
          <p>Visitors who are participating in a fundraising event organized and/or managed by Scholastic Challenge may be required to provide personal information (such as name, address, phone number, and email address) to register for or donate to an event. Scholastic Challenge collects such information only as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Scholastic Challenge. Scholastic Challenge does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
          <h5>If you are an event participant…</h5>
          <p>Your name, schools, personal message, photo, photo caption, and fundraising goal will appear on the website. We use your email to keep you informed about rider-related event information. If your school has a School Coordinator, we share your name, email, and phone number with the School Coordinator so you can be kept informed of ride activities related to your school. Your other personal information does not appear on the website and we do not give out to anyone, except as described elsewhere in this policy.</p>
          <h5>If you are an event donor…</h5>
          <p>Your donor name, donation amount, and message will appear on your rider’s fundraising page. We will use your email to keep you informed about the event. Your donor name, email, phone, donation amount, and message will be emailed to your rider to inform them of your support (so they can thank you). If you are paying by credit card, your personal information is transmitted to the credit card payment form for submission to the credit card processing entity. We do not store any credit card information (see our Security statement). Your other personal information does not appear on the website and we do not give out to anyone, except as described elsewhere in this policy.</p>
          <h4>Aggregated Statistics</h4>
          <p>Scholastic Challenge may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. Scholastic Challenge may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Scholastic Challenge does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
          <h4>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h4>
          <p>Scholastic Challenge discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Scholastic Challenge's behalf or to provide services available at Scholastic Challenge's website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Scholastic Challenge's website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.</p>
          <p>
          Scholastic Challenge will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Scholastic Challenge discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Scholastic Challenge believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Scholastic Challenge, third parties or the public at large.
          </p>
          <p>
          If you are a registered user of the Scholastic Challenge website and have supplied your email address, Scholastic Challenge may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new events, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Scholastic Challenge. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.

You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Scholastic Challenge may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>
          <h4>Ads</h4>
          <p>Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies.

This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Scholastic Challenge and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
          <h4>Privacy Policy Changes</h4>
